Title: Solar PV-Fed SEPIC Converter for Drive Application

Abstract:

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) fed Single-Ended Primary Inductor Converter (SEPIC) for drive applications. The increasing demand for sustainable and renewable energy sources has led to a growing interest in solar power for various applications, including electric drives. The SEPIC converter is chosen for its ability to step up or step down the input voltage efficiently, making it suitable for the variable output characteristics of solar PV panels.

The proposed system integrates a solar PV array, a SEPIC converter, and a motor drive system. The solar PV array converts sunlight into electrical energy, and the SEPIC converter optimizes the harvested energy for the drive application. The SEPIC converter offers advantages such as continuous input current, reduced voltage stress on the semiconductors, and a wider input voltage range.

The key objectives of the project include:

1. **Solar Power Harvesting**: Efficiently capture solar energy using PV panels to power the drive system.

2. **SEPIC Converter Design**: Develop and optimize the SEPIC converter for the specific requirements of the drive application, considering factors such as input voltage variations and output voltage regulation.

3. **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)**: Implement MPPT algorithms to ensure the solar PV array operates at its maximum power output under varying environmental conditions.

4. **Motor Drive System**: Design and implement a motor drive system compatible with the output of the SEPIC converter, ensuring smooth and reliable operation.

5. **Control and Monitoring**: Develop a control system to manage the power flow, voltage regulation, and overall performance of the drive system. Implement monitoring features for system health and performance analysis.

6. **Efficiency Optimization**: Optimize the overall system efficiency to make the most effective use of the harvested solar energy.

The successful implementation of this project would result in a sustainable and energy-efficient drive system powered by solar energy. Such systems have the potential to find applications in areas with limited access to the grid or where a clean and renewable power source is desired. Additionally, the project contributes to the ongoing efforts to reduce dependency on conventional energy sources and mitigate environmental impacts.
